    <para><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e4965" significance="normal"><primary>build jobs</primary></indexterm>Build jobs are the basic currency of a CI
    server.</para>
    <para>A build job is a particular way of compiling, testing, packaging,
    deploying, or otherwise doing something with your project. Build jobs come
    in a variety of forms; you may want to compile and unit test your
    application, report on code quality metrics related to the source code,
    generate documentation, bundle up an application for a release, deploy it
    to production, run an automated smoke test, or do any number of other
    similar tasks.</para>
    <para>A software project will usually have several related build jobs. For
    example, you might choose to start off with a dedicated build job that
    runs all of your unit tests. If these pass, you might proceed to a build
    job that executes longer-running integration tests, runs code quality
    metrics, or generates technical documentation, before finally <phrase role="keep-together">bundling</phrase> up your web application and
    deploying it to a test server.</para>
    <para>In Jenkins, build jobs are easy to set up. In this chapter, we'll
    look at the main types of build jobs and how to configure them. In later
    chapters, we'll take things further, looking at how to organize multiple
    build jobs, how to set up build promotion pipelines, and how to automate
    the deployment process. But, for now, let’s start off with how to set up
    your basic build jobs in Jenkins.</para>

    a few configuration details.</para>
    <para>In this chapter, we'll focus on the first two types of build jobs,
    which are the most commonly used. We'll discuss the others later on.
    Let’s start with the most flexible option: the freestyle build<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5079" class="endofrange" startref="ch05-create" significance="normal"><primary/></indexterm> job.</para>

    <title>Creating a Freestyle Build Job</title>
    <para>The <indexterm class="startofrange" id="ch05-free" significance="normal"><primary>freestyle build jobs</primary></indexterm>freestyle build job is the most flexible and configurable
    option, and can be used for any type of project. It's relatively
    straightforward to set up, and many of the options you configure here also
    appear in other build jobs.</para>
    <sect2 id="sect-general-options">
      <title>General Options</title>
      <para>The first section you see when you create a new freestyle job
      contains general information about the project, such as a unique name
      and description, and other information about how and where the build job
      should be executed (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-new-project-general"/>).</para>

      noting that it will be used for the project directory and the build job
      URL, so I generally avoid names with spaces. The <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5114" significance="normal"><primary>freestyle build jobs</primary><secondary>description of, for project home page</secondary></indexterm>project description will go on the project home page—use
      this to provide an overview of the build job’s goals and context. HTML
      tags will work fine in this field.</para>
      <para>The other options are more technical, and we'll be looking at
      some of them in detail later on in the book.</para>
      <para>One<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5124" significance="normal"><primary>freestyle build jobs</primary><secondary>build history for, number of builds to keep</secondary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5129" significance="normal"><primary>build history</primary><secondary>number of builds to keep</secondary></indexterm> important aspect that you should think about upfront is
      how you want to handle build history. Build jobs can consume a lot of
      disk space, especially if you store the build artifacts (the binary
      files, such as JARs, WARs, TARs, etc. generated by your build job).
      Even without artifacts, keeping a record of every build job consumes
      additional disk space and memory, which may or may not be justified,
      depending on the nature of your build job. For example, for a code
      quality metrics build that reports on static analysis and code coverage
      metrics over time, you might want to keep a record of the builds for the
      duration of the project, whereas, for a build job that automatically
      deploys an application to a test server, keeping the build history and
      artifacts for posterity might be less important.</para>
      <para>The Discard Old Builds option lets you limit the number of builds
      you record in the build history. You can either tell Jenkins to only
      keep recent builds (Jenkins will delete builds after a certain number of
      days), or to keep no more than a specified number of builds. If a
      certain build has particular sentimental value, you can always tell
      Jenkins to keep it forever by using the Keep forever button on the build
      details page (see <xref linkend="fig-jenkins-keep-forever"/>). Note
      that this button will only appear if you've asked Jenkins to discard
      old builds.</para>

      </figure>
      <para>In addition, Jenkins will never delete the last stable and
      successful builds, no matter how old they are. For example, if you limit
      Jenkins to only keep the last twenty builds, and your last successful
      build was thirty builds ago, Jenkins will still keep the successful
      build job as well as the last twenty failing builds.</para>
      <para>You<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5151" significance="normal"><primary>freestyle build jobs</primary><secondary>disabling</secondary></indexterm> also have the option to disable the build. A disabled
      build won't be executed until you enable it again. Using this option
      when you create a new build job is quite rare. On the other hand, this
      option often comes in handy to temporarily suspend a build during
      maintenance work or major refactoring, when notification of the build
      failures won't be useful for the team.</para>

      lets you override the system-wide quiet period defined in the Jenkins
      System Configuration screen (see <xref linkend="sect-configuration-system"/>). This option is mainly used for
      version control systems that don’t support atomic commits, such as
      <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5185" significance="normal"><primary>CVS</primary><secondary>delaying build jobs</secondary></indexterm>CVS, but it's also sometimes used in teams where
      developers have the habit of committing their work in several small
      commits.</para>
      <para>The<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5193" significance="normal"><primary>freestyle build jobs</primary><secondary>blocking for upstream projects</secondary></indexterm> “Block build when upstream project is building” option is
      useful when several related projects are affected by a single commit,
      but they must be built in a specific order. If you activate this option,
      Jenkins will wait until any upstream build jobs (see <xref linkend="sect-build-triggers"/>) have finished before starting this
      build.</para>
      <para>For instance, when you release a new version of a multimodule
      Maven project, version number updates will happen in many, if not all,
      of the project modules. Suppose, for example, that we've added a web
      application to the Game of Life project you used in <xref linkend="chapter-first-steps"/>, setting it up as a separate Maven
      project. When you release a new version of this project, both the core
      and the web application version numbers will be updated (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-new-job-version-updates"/>). Before you can build
      the web application, you need to build a new version of the original Game
      of Life core module. However, if you had a separate freestyle build job
      for each module, then the build jobs for both the core and the web
      application would start simultaneously. The web application build job
      will fail if the core build job hasn’t produced a new version of the
      core module, even if there are no test failures.</para>
      <para>To avoid this issue, you could set up the web application build
      job to <emphasis>only</emphasis> start once the core build has
      successfully terminated. However, this would mean that the web
      application would never be built if changes were made that only affected
      it, and not the core module. A better approach is to use the “Block
      build when upstream project” option. In this case, when the version
      numbers are updated in version control, Jenkins will schedule both
      builds to be executed. However, it will wait until the core build has
      finished before starting the web application build.</para>

      <para>You <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5222" significance="normal"><primary>freestyle build jobs</primary><secondary>workspace for, overriding</secondary></indexterm>can also override the default workspace used by Jenkins to
      check out the source code and build your project. Normally, Jenkins will
      create a special workspace directory for your project, which can be
      found in the project’s build job directory (see <xref linkend="sec-hudson-home-directory-contents"/>). This works fine in
      almost all cases. However, there are times when you need to override
      this option and force Jenkins to use a special directory. One common
      example of this is if you want several build jobs to all work
      successively in the same directory. You can override the default
      directory by <phrase role="keep-together">ticking</phrase> the “Use
      custom workspace” option and providing the path yourself. The path can
      be either absolute or relative to Jenkins’s home directory.</para>

    monitors your version control system, and checks out the latest changes as

      and Jenkins comes bundled with full Subversion support (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-new-job-svn"/>). To use source code from a
      Subversion repository, you simply provide the corresponding Subversion
      URL—it will work fine with any of the three Subversion protocols of
      (http, svn, or file). Jenkins will check that the URL is valid as soon
      as you enter it. If the repository requires authentication, Jenkins will
      prompt you for the corresponding credentials automatically, and store
      them for any other build jobs that access this repository.</para>

      <para>By default, Jenkins will check out the repository contents into a
      subdirectory of your workspace whose name will match the last element
      in the Subversion URL. So, if your Subversion URL is <ulink url="svn://localhost/gameoflife/trunk"/>, Jenkins will check out
      the repository contents to a directory called <filename moreinfo="none">trunk</filename> in the build job workspace. If you
      would prefer another directory name, just enter the directory name you
      want in the "Local module directory"
      field. Place a period (“.”) here if you want Jenkins to check the source
      code directly into the workspace.</para>
      <para>Occasionally you may need to get source code from more than one
      Subversion URL. In this case, just use the “Add more locations...”
      button to add as many additional <phrase role="keep-together">repository</phrase> sources as you need.</para>
      <para>A well-designed build process shouldn't modify the source code,
      or leave any extra files that might confuse your version control system
      or the build process. Both generated artifacts and temporary files (such
      as log files, reports, test data, or file-based databases) should go in a
      directory set aside for this purpose (such as the <filename moreinfo="none">target</filename> directory in Maven builds), and/or be
      configured to be ignored by your version control repository. They should
      also be deleted as part of the build process, once the build has
      finished with them. This is also an important part of ensuring a clean
      and reproducible build <phrase role="keep-together">process—</phrase>for
      a given version of your source code, your build should behave in exactly
      the same way, no matter where or when it's run. Locally changed source
      code files, and the presence of temporary files, both have the potential
      of compromising this.</para>
      <para>You can fine-tune the way Jenkins obtains the latest source code
      from your Subversion repository by selecting an appropriate value in the
      Check-out Strategy drop-down list. If your project is well-behaved,
      however, you may be able to speed things up substantially by selecting
      “Use ‘svn update’ as much as possible”. This is the fastest option, but
      may leave artifacts and files from previous builds in your workspace. To
      be on the safe side, you may want to use the second option (“Use ‘svn
      update’ as much as possible, with ‘svn revert’ before update”), which
      will systematically run <literal moreinfo="none">svn revert</literal> before running
      <literal moreinfo="none">svn update</literal>. This will ensure that no local files have
      been modified, though it won't remove any new files that have been
      created during the build process. Alternatively, you can ask Jenkins to
      delete any unversioned or ignored files before performing an
      <literal moreinfo="none">svn update</literal>, or play it safe by checking out a full
      clean copy for each build.</para>

      build. In the Advanced section, you can use the Excluded Regions field
      to tell Jenkins not to trigger a build if only certain files were
      changed. This field takes a list of regular expressions which identify
      files that should <emphasis>not</emphasis> trigger a build. For example,
      suppose you don’t want Jenkins to start a new build if only images have
      been changed. To do this, you could use a set of regular expressions
      like the following:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e5368" format="linespecific">/trunk/gameoflife/gameoflife-web/src/main/webapp/.*\.jpg
/trunk/gameoflife/gameoflife-web/src/main/webapp/.*\.gif
/trunk/gameoflife/gameoflife-web/src/main/webapp/.*\.png</programlisting>
      <para>Alternatively, you can specify the Included Regions, if you're
      only interested in changes in part of the source code directory
      structure. You can even combine the Excluded Regions and Included
      Regions fields—in this case a modified file will only trigger a build if
      it's in the Included Regions but not in the Excluded Regions.</para>

      if your project uses Maven, you may want to use the Maven Release Plugin
      to promote your application from snapshot<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5409" significance="normal"><primary>SNAPSHOT versions</primary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e5412" significance="normal"><primary>Maven</primary><secondary>SNAPSHOT versions</secondary></indexterm> versions to official releases. This plugin will
      automatically bump up the version number of your application from a
      snapshot version used during development (such as 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT) to a
      release (1.0.1), bundle up and deploy a release of your application
      with this version number, and then move the version on to the next
      snapshot number (e.g., 1.0.2-SNAPSHOT) for ongoing development. During
      this <phrase role="keep-together">process</phrase> Maven takes care of
      many SCM bookkeeping tasks, such as committing the source code with the
      release version number and creating a tag for the released version of
      your application, and then committing the source code with the new
      snapshot version <phrase role="keep-together">number</phrase>.</para>
      <para>Suppose you have a special build job for generating a new
      release using this <phrase role="keep-together">process</phrase>. The
      many commits generated by the Maven Release Plugin would normally
      trigger build jobs in Jenkins. However, since the release build job
      is already compiling and testing this version of your application, you
      don’t need Jenkins to do it again in a separate build job. To ensure
      that Jenkins doesn't trigger a build for this case, you can use the
      Excluded Commit Messages field with the following value:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e5430" format="linespecific">[maven-release-plugin] prepare release.*</programlisting>
      <para>This will ensure that Jenkins skips the changes corresponding to
      the new release version, but not those corresponding to the next

      whenever another build has finished. This is an easy way to set up a
      build pipeline. For example, you might set up an initial build job to
      run unit and integration tests, followed by another separate build job
      to run more CPU-intensive code quality metrics. You simply enter the
      name of the preceding build job in this field. If the build job can be
      triggered by several other build jobs, just list their names here,
      separated by commas. In this case, the build job will be triggered once
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> of the build jobs in the list finish.</para>
      <para>There's a symmetrical field in the Post-build actions section of
      the preceding build job called (appropriately enough) “Build other
      projects”. This field will be automatically updated in the corresponding
      build jobs whenever you modify the “Build after other projects are
      built” field. However, unlike the “Build after other projects are built”
      field, this field gives you the option to trigger a build even if the
      build is <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e6325" significance="normal"><primary>build jobs</primary><secondary>unstable build from</secondary><tertiary>triggering another build after</tertiary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e6332" significance="normal"><primary>unstable builds</primary><secondary>triggering another build job after</secondary></indexterm>unstable (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-new-job-trigger-build-after"/>). This is useful,
      for example, if you want to run a code quality metrics build job even if
      there are unit test failures in the default build job.</para>

      <title>Scheduled Build Jobs</title>
      <para>Another<indexterm class="startofrange" id="ch05-regular" significance="normal"><primary>build triggers</primary><secondary sortas="regular">at regular intervals</secondary></indexterm> strategy is simply to trigger your build job at regular
      intervals. It's important to note that this isn't actually CI
      —it's simply scheduled builds, something you could also do,
      for example, with a Unix cron job. In the early days of automated builds,
      and even today in many shops, builds aren't run in response to changes
      committed to version control, but simply on a nightly basis. However, to
      be effective, a CI server should provide feedback
      much more quickly than once a day.</para>
      <para>There are nevertheless a few cases where scheduled builds do make
      sense. This includes very long running build jobs, where quick feedback
      is less critical. For example, intensive load and performance tests
      which may take several hours to run, or <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e6361" significance="normal"><primary>Sonar</primary><secondary>frequency of builds</secondary></indexterm>. Sonar build jobs are an excellent way to keep tabs
      on code quality metrics across your projects and over time, but the
      Sonar server only stores one set of data per day, so running Sonar
      builds more frequently than this isn't useful.</para>
      <para>For all scheduling tasks, Jenkins uses a cron-style syntax,
      consisting of five fields separated by white space in the following
      format:</para>
      <simplelist type="vert">

          <para>“*” represents all possible values for a field. For example,

        <listitem>
          <para>You can define ranges using the “M–N” notation. For example

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can use the slash notation to define skips through a

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A comma-separated list indicates a list of valid values. For
          example, “15,45” in the MINUTE field would mean “at 15 and 45
          minutes past every hour.”</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can also use the shorthand values of “@yearly”,

      <title>Polling the SCM</title>
      <para>As <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e6433" significance="normal"><primary>build triggers</primary><secondary>polling SCM for version control changes</secondary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e6438" significance="normal"><primary>version control systems</primary><secondary>polling for changes to trigger build</secondary></indexterm>you've seen, scheduled build jobs are usually not the
      best strategy for most <phrase role="keep-together">CI build</phrase>
      jobs. The value of any feedback is proportional to the speed in which
      you receive that feedback, and CI is no exception.
      That's why polling the SCM is generally a better option.</para>
      <para>Polling involves asking the version control server at regular
      intervals if any source code changes have been committed. If so,
      Jenkins kicks off a build.
      Polling is usually a relatively cheap operation, so you can poll
      frequently to ensure that a build kicks off rapidly after changes have
      been committed. The more frequent the polling is, the faster the build
      jobs will start, and the more accurate the feedback about what change
      broke the build will be.</para>
      <para>In Jenkins, SCM polling is easy to configure, and uses the same
      cron syntax we discussed previously.</para>
      <para>The natural temptation for SCM polling is to poll as often as
      possible (for example, using “* * * * *”, or once every minute). Since
      Jenkins simply queries the version control system, and only kicks off a
      build if the source code has been modified, this approach is often
      reasonable for small projects. It shows its limits if there is a very
      large number of build jobs, as this may saturate the SCM server and the
      network with queries, many of them unnecessary. In this case, a more
      precise approach is better, where the Jenkins build job is triggered by
      the SCM when it receives a change. We discuss this option in <xref linkend="sect-build-trigger-remote"/>.</para>
      <para>If updates are frequently committed to the version control system,
      across many projects, this may cause many build jobs to be queued, which
      can in turn slow down feedback times further. You can reduce the build
      queue to some extent by polling less frequently, but at the cost of less
      precise feedback.</para>
      <para>If you're using <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e6459" significance="normal"><primary>CVS</primary><secondary>polling with</secondary></indexterm>CVS, polling may not be a good option. When CVS checks for
      changes in a project, it checks each file one by one, which is a slow
      and tedious process. The best solution here is to migrate to a modern
      version control system such as Git or Subversion. The second-best
      solution is to use polling at very sparse intervals (for example, every
      30 minutes).</para>

      doesn't scale particularly well—with large numbers of build jobs, it's
      wasteful of network resources, and there's always a small delay between
      the code change being committed and the build job starting. A more
      precise strategy is to get the SCM system to trigger the Jenkins build
      whenever a change is committed.</para>
      <para>It's easy to start a Jenkins build job remotely. You simply
      invoke a URL of the following form:</para>
      <simplelist type="vert">
        <member>
          <emphasis>http://SERVER/jenkins/job/PROJECTNAME/build</emphasis>
        </member>
      </simplelist>
      <para>For example, if my Jenkins server was running on
      <emphasis>http://myserver:8080/jenkins</emphasis>, I could start the
      <emphasis>gameoflife</emphasis> build job by invoking the following URL
      using a tool like <literal moreinfo="none">wget</literal> or
      <literal moreinfo="none">curl</literal>:</para>
      <screen format="linespecific">$ <userinput moreinfo="none">wget http://myserver:8080/jenkins/job/gameoflife/build</userinput></screen>
      <para>The trick, then, is to get your version control server to do this
      whenever a change is committed. The details of how to do this are
      different for each version control system. In Subversion, for example,
      you'd need to write a post-commit hook script, which would trigger a
      build. You could, for example, write a Subversion hook script that
      parses the repository URL to extract the project name, and performs a
      <literal moreinfo="none">wget</literal> operation on the URL of the corresponding build
      job:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e6510" format="linespecific">JENKINS_SERVER=http://myserver:8080/jenkins
REPOS="$1"
PROJECT=<emphasis>&lt;Regular Expression Processing Goes Here&gt;</emphasis><co id="svn-hook-1"/>
/usr/bin/wget $JENKINS_SERVER/job/${PROJECT}/build</programlisting>
      <calloutlist>
        <callout arearefs="svn-hook-1">
          <para>Use regular expression processing here to extract your project
          name from the Subversion repository URL.</para>
        </callout>
      </calloutlist>
      <para>However, this approach will only trigger one particular build, and
      relies on the convention that the default build job is based on the
      repository name in Subversion. A more flexible approach with Subversion
      is to use the Jenkins Subversion API directly, as shown here:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e6522" format="linespecific">JENKINS_SERVER=http://myserver:8080/jenkins
REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"
UUID=`svnlook uuid $REPOS`
/usr/bin/wget \
  --header "Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8" \
  --post-data "`svnlook changed --revision $REV $REPOS`" \
  --output-document "-" \
  --timeout=2 \
  $JENKINS_SERVER/subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=$REV</programlisting>
      <para>This would automatically start any Jenkins build jobs monitoring
      this Subversion <phrase role="keep-together">repository</phrase>.</para>
      <para>If you've activated Jenkins security, things become a little
      more complicated. In the simplest case (where any user can do anything),
      you need to activate the “Trigger builds remotely” option (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-builds-tokens"/>), and provide a special string
      that can be used in the URL:</para>
      <simplelist type="vert">
        <member>
          <emphasis>http://SERVER/jenkins/job/PROJECTNAME/build?token=DOIT</emphasis>

      time to download all of the Maven artifacts, and private repositories
      can take up a lot of space. However, it's the best way of guaranteeing

      <para>Now, you can add some Groovy scripting to your build job. When you
      click on “Add build step”, you'll see two new entries in the drop-down
      menu: “Execute Groovy script” and “Execute system Groovy script”. The
      first option is generally what you <phrase role="keep-together">want—</phrase>this will simply execute a Groovy
      script in a separate JVM, as if you were invoking Groovy from the
      command line. The second option runs Groovy commands within Jenkins’s
      own JVM, with full access to Jenkins’s internals, and is mainly used to
      manipulate the Jenkins build jobs or build process itself. This is a
      more advanced topic that we'll discuss later on in the book.</para>
      <para>A Groovy build step can take one of two forms. For simple cases,
      you can just add a small snippet of Groovy, as shown in <xref linkend="fig-hudson-groovy-build-step"/>. For more involved or
      complicated cases, you'd probably write a Groovy script and place it
      under version control. Once your script is safely in your SCM, you can
      run it by selecting the “Groovy script file” option and providing the
      path to your script (relative to your build job workspace).</para>

      reporting test results such as whether there are any test failures,
      but also how many tests were executed, how long they took to execute,
      and so on. In the Java world, JUnit is the most commonly-used testing
      library around. The JUnit XML format for test results is widely used
      and understood by other tools as well.</para>
      <para>Jenkins provides great support for test reporting. In a freestyle
      build job, you need to tick the “Publish JUnit test result report”
      option, and provide a path to your JUnit report files (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-build-job-junit"/>). You can use a wildcard
      expression (such as <literal moreinfo="none">**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml</literal>
      in a Maven project) to include JUnit reports from a number of different
      directories—Jenkins will aggregate the results into a single

      generally to build something. In Jenkins, we call this something an
      artifact. An artifact might be a binary executable (a JAR or WAR file
      for a Java project, for example), or some other related deliverable,
      such as documentation or source code. A build job can store any number of
      different artifacts, keeping only the latest copy or every artifact ever
      built.</para>
      <para>Configuring Jenkins to store your artifacts is easy—just tick the
      “Archive the artifacts” checkbox in the Post-build Actions, and specify
      which artifacts you want to store (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-build-job-artifact-configuration"/>).</para>

      <para>In the “Files to archive” field, you can provide the full paths of
      the files you want to archive (relative to the job workspace), or, use
      Ant-like wild cards (e.g., <literal moreinfo="none">**/*.jar</literal>, for all the JAR
      files, anywhere in the workspace). One advantage of using wild cards is
      that it makes your build less dependent on your version control set up.
      For example, if you're using Subversion (see <xref linkend="sect-subversion"/>), Jenkins will check out your project
      either directly in your workspace, or into a subdirectory, depending on
      how you set it up. If you use a wild card expression like
      <literal moreinfo="none">**/target/*.war</literal>, Jenkins will find the file no matter
      what directory the project is located in.</para>
      <para>As usual, the Advanced button give access to a few extra options.
      If you're using wild cards to find your artifacts, you might need to
      exclude certain directories from the search. You can do this by filling
      in the Excludes field. You enter a pattern to match any files that you
      <emphasis>don’t</emphasis> want to archive, even if they'd normally
      be included by the “Files to archive” field.</para>
      <para>Archived artifacts can take a lot of disk space, especially if
      builds are frequent. For this reason, you may want to only keep the last
      successful one. To do this, just tick the “Discard all but the last
      successful/stable artifact” option. Jenkins will keep artifacts from the
      last stable build (if there were any). It will also keep the artifacts
      of the latest unstable build following the stable build (if any), and
      also from the last failed build that happened.</para>
      <para>Archived build artifacts appear on the build results page (see
      <xref linkend="fig-hudson-build-artifact"/>). The most recent build
      artifacts are also displayed on the build job home page.</para>

      <para>You can also use permanent URLs to access the most recent build
      artifacts. This is a great way to reuse the latest artifacts from your
      builds, either in other Jenkins build jobs or in external scripts, for
      example. Three URLs are available: last stable build, last successful
      build, and last completed build.</para>
      <para>Before looking at the URLs, we should discuss the concept of
      <emphasis>stable</emphasis> and <emphasis>successful</emphasis>
      builds.</para>
      <para>A build is <emphasis>successful</emphasis> when the compilation
      reported no errors.</para>
      <para>A build is <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7379" significance="normal"><primary>build jobs</primary><secondary>unstable build from</secondary><tertiary>criteria for</tertiary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7386" significance="normal"><primary>unstable builds</primary><secondary>criteria for</secondary></indexterm>considered <emphasis>stable</emphasis> if it was built
      successfully, and no publisher reports it as unstable. For example,
      depending on your project configuration, unit test failures,
      insufficient code coverage, or other code quality metrics issues could
      cause a build to be marked as unstable. So, a stable build is always
      successful, but the opposite isn't necessarily true—a build can be
      successful without being stable.</para>
      <para>A <emphasis>completed</emphasis> build is simply a build that has
      finished, no matter what its result. Note that the archiving step will
      take place no matter what the outcome of the build was.</para>
      <para>The format of the artifact URLs is intuitive, and takes the
      following form:</para>

      <para>This is best illustrated by some examples. Suppose your Jenkins

      <para>Artifacts don’t have to be just executable binaries. Imagine, for
      example, that your build process involves automatically deploying each
      build to a test server. For convenience, you want to keep a copy of the
      exact source code associated with each deployed WAR file. One way to do
      this would be to generate the source code associated with a build, and
      archive both this file and the WAR file. We could do this by generating
      a JAR file containing the application source code (for example, by using
      the Maven Source Plugin for a Maven project), and then including this in
      the list of artifacts to store (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-archiving-source"/>).</para>

      <para>Of course, this example is a tad academic: it would probably be

      your version control system. But you get the idea.</para>
      <para>Note that if you're using an Enterprise Repository Manager such
      as Nexus or Artifactory to store your binary artifacts, you may not need
      to keep them on the Jenkins server. You may prefer simply to

    <para>In <indexterm class="startofrange" id="ch05-mavenjob" significance="normal"><primary>Maven build jobs</primary></indexterm>this section, we'll have a look at the other most commonly
    used build job: Maven 2/3 build jobs.</para>
    <para>Maven build jobs are specifically adapted to Maven 2 and Maven 3
    builds. Creating a Maven build job requires considerably less work than
    configuring the equivalent <phrase role="keep-together">freestyle</phrase>
    build job. Maven build jobs support advanced Maven-related features such
    as incremental builds on multimodule projects and triggering builds from
    changes in snapshot dependencies, making configuration and reporting
    much simpler.</para>
    <para>However, there's a catch: Maven 2/3 build jobs are less flexible
    than freestyle build jobs, and don’t support multiple build steps within
    the same build job. Some users also report that large Maven projects tend
    to run more slowly and use more memory when configured as Maven build jobs
    rather than as freestyle ones.</para>
    <para>In this section, we'll investigate how to configure Maven 2/3
    builds, when you can use them, as well as their advantages and

      very similar to the one you saw for freestyle builds in the previous
      section. The first difference you may notice is in the Build Triggers
      section. In this section, an extra option is available: “Build whenever
      a SNAPSHOT dependency is built”. If you select this option, Jenkins will
      examine your <filename moreinfo="none">pom.xml</filename> file (or
      files) to see if any SNAPSHOT dependencies are being built by other
      build jobs. If any other build jobs update a SNAPSHOT dependency that
      your project uses, Jenkins will build your project as well.</para>
      <para>Typically in Maven, SNAPSHOT dependencies are used to share the
      latest bleeding-edge version of a library with other projects within the
      same team. Since they're by definition unstable, it isn't recommended
      practice to rely on SNAPSHOT dependencies from other teams or from
      external sources.</para>
      <para>For example, imagine that you're working on a new
      <emphasis>game-of-life</emphasis> web application. You are using Maven
      for this project, so you can use a Maven build job in Jenkins. Your team
      is also working on a reusable library called
      <emphasis>cooltools</emphasis>. Since these two projects are being
      developed by the same team, you're using some of the latest
      <emphasis>cooltools</emphasis> features in the
      <emphasis>game-of-life</emphasis> web application. So, you have a
      SNAPSHOT dependency in the <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> section of
      your <emphasis>game-of-life</emphasis> <filename moreinfo="none">pom.xml</filename> file:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e7672" format="linespecific">    &lt;dependencies&gt;

        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;</programlisting>
      <para>On your Jenkins server, you've set up Maven build jobs for both
      the <emphasis>cooltools</emphasis> and the
      <emphasis>game-of-life</emphasis> applications. Since your
      <emphasis>game-of-life</emphasis> project needs the latest
      <emphasis>cooltools</emphasis> SNAPSHOT version, you tick the “Build
      whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built” option. This way, whenever the

      to invoke. You can also add any command-line options you need

      <para>The Incremental Build option<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7738" significance="normal"><primary>Maven build jobs</primary><secondary>incremental builds</secondary></indexterm> comes in very handy for large, multimodule Maven builds.
      If you tick this option, when a change is made to one of the project
      modules, Jenkins will only rebuild that module and any modules that use
      the changed module. It performs this magic by using some new Maven
      features introduced in Maven 2.1 (so it won’t work if you're using
      Maven 2.0.x). Jenkins detects which modules have been changed, and then
      uses the <literal moreinfo="none">-pl</literal> (<literal moreinfo="none">--project-list</literal>)
      option to build only the updated modules, and the
      <literal moreinfo="none">-amd</literal> (<literal moreinfo="none">--also-make-dependents</literal>)
      option to build the modules that use the updated modules. If nothing has
      been changed in the source code, all of the modules are built.</para>
      <para>By default, Jenkins<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7758" significance="normal"><primary>Maven build jobs</primary><secondary>archiving binary artifacts, disabling</secondary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7763" significance="normal"><primary>archives of binary artifacts</primary><secondary>disabling</secondary></indexterm><indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7768" significance="normal"><primary>binary artifacts</primary><secondary>archiving</secondary><tertiary>disabling</tertiary></indexterm> will archive all of the artifacts generated by a Maven
      build job. This can come in handy at times, but it can also be very
      expensive in disk storage. If you want to turn off this option, just
      tick the “Disable automatic artifact archiving” option. Alternatively,
      you can always limit the artifacts stored by using the “Discard Old
      Builds” option at the top of the configuration page.</para>
      <para>The “Build modules in parallel” option<indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7778" significance="normal"><primary>Maven build jobs</primary><secondary>running modules in parallel</secondary></indexterm> tells Jenkins to run each individual module in parallel
      as a separate build. In theory, this could speed up your builds quite a
      bit. In practice, it will only really work if your modules are totally
      independent (that is, you aren’t using aggregation), which is rarely the
      case. If you think building your modules in parallel could really speed
      up your multimodule project, you may want to try a freestyle build with
      Maven 3 and its new parallel build feature.</para>
      <para>Another <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7786" significance="normal"><primary>Maven build jobs</primary><secondary>private repository for</secondary></indexterm>useful option is “Use [a] private Maven repository”.
      Normally, when Jenkins runs Maven, it will behave in exactly the same
      way as Maven on the command line: it will store artifacts in, and
      retrieve artifacts from the local Maven repository (found in <filename moreinfo="none">~/.m2/repository</filename> if you'vet reconfigured
      it in the <filename moreinfo="none">settings.xml</filename> file). This
      is efficient in terms of disk space, but not always ideal for CI builds.
      Indeed, if several build jobs are working on and with the same snapshot
      artifacts, the builds may end up interfering with each other.</para>
      <para>When this option is checked, Jenkins will tell Maven to use
      <filename moreinfo="none">$WORKSPACE/.repository</filename> as the local Maven
      repository. This means each job will get its own isolated Maven
      repository just for itself. It fixes the above problems, at the expense
      of additional disk space consumption.</para>
      <para>Another way of addressing this problem is to override the default
      repository location by using the <literal moreinfo="none">maven.repo.local</literal>
      property, as shown here:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e7814" format="linespecific">$ <userinput moreinfo="none">mvn install -Dmaven.repo.local=~/.m2/staging-repository</userinput></programlisting>
      <para>This approach has the advantage of being able to share a
      repository across several build jobs, which is useful if you need to do
      a series of related builds. It will also work with freestyle
      jobs.</para>

      <para>The <indexterm id="I_indexterm5_d1e7825" significance="normal"><primary>Maven build jobs</primary><secondary>Post-build Actions</secondary></indexterm>Post-Build actions in a Maven build job are considerably
      simpler to configure than in a freestyle job. This is simply because,
      since this is a Maven build, Jenkins knows where to look for a lot of
      the build output. Artifacts, test reports, Javadoc, and so forth are
      all generated in standard directories, which means
      <emphasis>you</emphasis> don’t have to tell Jenkins where to find
      things. So, Jenkins will find, and report on, JUnit test results
      automatically, for example. Later on in the book, we'll see how the
      Maven projects also simplify the configuration of many code quality
      metrics tools and reports.</para>

      ability to deploy your artifacts to a Maven repository (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-maven2-deploy"/>). An Enterprise Repository Manager
      is a server that acts as both a proxy/cache for public Maven artifacts,
      and as a central storage server for your own internal artifacts. Open
      Source Enterprise Repository Managers like Nexus (from Sonatype) and
      Artifactory (from JFrog) provide powerful maintenance and administration
      features that make configuring and maintaining your Maven repositories a
      lot simpler. Both these products have commercial versions, with
      additional features aimed at more sophisticated or high-end build
      infrastructures.</para>
      <para>The advantage of getting Jenkins to deploy your artifacts (as
      opposed to simply running <literal moreinfo="none">mvn deploy</literal>) is that, if you
      have a multimodule Maven build, the artifacts will only be deployed once
      the entire build has finished successfully. For example, suppose you
      have a multimodule Maven project with five modules. If you run
      <literal moreinfo="none">mvn deploy</literal>, and the build fails after three modules,
      the first two modules will have been deployed to your repository, but
      not the last three, which leaves your repository in an instable state.
      Getting Jenkins to do the deploy ensures that the artifacts are only
      deployed as a group once the build has successfully finished.</para>

      <para>To do this, just tick the “Deploy artifacts to Maven repository”

      and not just <emphasis>http://nexus.acme.com/nexus</emphasis>)</para>
      <para>Most repositories need you to authenticate before letting you
      deploy artifacts to them. The standard Maven way to do this is to place
      a <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;server&gt;</literal> entry in your local <filename moreinfo="none">settings.xml</filename> file, as shown here:</para>

      <para>Jenkins provides excellent support for Grails builds. First, you

      will need to provide at least one version of Grails for Jenkins to use
      in the Grails Builder section of the Configure System screen (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-build-job-grails-builder"/>).</para>

      <para>Now, you can set up a freestyle build job to build your Grails

      which you can use to build your Grails application (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-build-job-grails"/>). Here, you provide the Grails
      target, or targets, you want to execute. Unlike the command line, you
      can execute several targets in the same command. However, if you need to
      pass any arguments to a particular target, you should enclose the target
      and its arguments in double quotes. In <xref linkend="fig-hudson-build-job-grails"/>, for example, you run
      <literal moreinfo="none">grails clean</literal>, followed by <literal moreinfo="none">grails test-app
      -unit -non-interactive</literal>. To get this to work properly, we
      enclose the options of the second command in quotes, which gives us

      example, you may want to tick the Force Upgrade checkbox, which makes
      sure that runs <literal moreinfo="none">grails upgrade --non-interactive</literal>

      tasks, and uses Maven-like declarative dependency management. The

      scripts with very little code, albeit at the cost of loosing the IDE
      support that exists for established tools like Ant and Maven.</para>
      <para>There are two different ways to run your Gradle builds with

        <para>Once Jenkins has restarted, you'll need to configure your new

        <para>While running a Gradle build job with unchanged sources, Gradle
        runs its builds incrementally. If the output of a Gradle task is still

        of a running build job considerably.</para>
        <para>If Gradle evaluates the test task as up-to-date, even the

NAnt is a
      .NET version of the Ant build scripting tool widely used in the Java
      world. NAnt build scripts are XML files (typically with a <filename moreinfo="none">.build</filename> extension), with a very similar format
      to Ant build scripts.</para>
      <para>To build with NAnt in Jenkins, you need to install the Jenkins

      installation directory in the Nant Builders section (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-msbuild-config"/>).</para>
      <para>Now, go to the Build section of your freestyle project and choose
      “Execute NAnt build” (see <xref linkend="fig-hudson-nant-step"/>). Here
      you specify your build script and the target you want to invoke. If you
      click on the “Advanced...” option, you can also set property values to
      be passed into the NAnt script.</para>

      into your Ruby and Ruby on Rails projects. The Rake Plugin lets you add
      Rake build steps to your build jobs. You can also use the Ruby Plugin which
      lets you run Ruby scripts directly in your build job. Finally, the Ruby
      Metrics Plugin provides support for Ruby code quality metrics tools such
      as RCov, Rails stats, and Flog.</para>
      <para>Another invaluable tool in this area is
      <literal moreinfo="none">CI:Reporter</literal>. This library is an add-on to
      <literal moreinfo="none">Test::Unit</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">RSpec</literal>, and
      <literal moreinfo="none">Cucumber</literal> that generates JUnit-compatible XML reports
      for your tests. As you'll see, JUnit-compatible test results can be
      used directly by Jenkins to report on your test results. You'd
      install CI:Reporter using Gem as illustrated here:</para>
      <screen format="linespecific">$ <userinput moreinfo="none">sudo gem install ci_reporter</userinput>
Successfully installed ci_reporter-1.6.4
1 gem installed</screen>
      <para>Next, you'll need to set this up in your Rakefile by adding the
      following:</para>
      <programlisting id="I_programlisting5_d1e8431" format="linespecific">require 'rubygems'
gem 'ci_reporter'
require 'ci/reporter/rake/test_unit' # use this if you're using Test::Unit</programlisting>
      <para>In <xref linkend="chapter-code-quality"/>, we discuss integrating
      code quality metrics into your Jenkins builds. Jenkins also provides
      support for code coverage metrics in Ruby. The Ruby Metrics Plugin
      supports code coverage metrics using <command moreinfo="none">rcov</command> as well as general code statistics with
      <command moreinfo="none">Rails stats</command>. To install the <command moreinfo="none">rcov-plugin</command>, you'll first need to run
      something along the following lines:</para>
      <screen format="linespecific">$ <userinput moreinfo="none">./script/plugin install http://svn.codahale.com/rails_rcov</userinput></screen>
      <para>Once this is set up, you'll be able to display your test results
      and test result trends in Jenkins.</para>
      <para>Finally, you can configure a Rake build simply by using a Rake
      build step, as illustrated in <xref linkend="fig-hudson-rake-step"/>.</para>

      The JUnit XML reports will be found in the <filename moreinfo="none">results</filename> directory (enter
