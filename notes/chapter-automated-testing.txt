Automated testing with Hudson

If you are doing Continuous Integration without automated testing, you are not getting anywhere near as much out of your CI server as you should. One of the fundamental tenants of CI is that a build should be verifiable. Hudson should be able to tell you, clearly and without ambiguity, whether your build is ready to proceed to the next stage of the build process. And automated tests are your most important tool to help you decide whether your build is a valid one.

- Automating your tests

Hudson does an excellent job of reporting on your test results. However, it is up to you to write the appropriate tests and to configure your build to run them automatically. Fortunately integrating JUnit into your automated builds is relatively easy.

-- Automating your tests with Maven

Test automation is strongly supported in Maven. Maven projects use a standard directory structure: it will automatically look for unit tests in a directory called *src/test/java*.  There is little else to configure: just add a dependency to the test framework (or frameworks) your tests are using, and Maven will automatically look for and execute the JUnit, TestNG or even POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) tests contained in this directory structure.

Maven will produce the test results in the *target/surefire-reports* directory, in both XML and text formats. For our CI purposes, it is the XML files that interest us.

$ ls target/surefire-reports/*.xml
target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.wakaleo.training.tweeter.domain.HamcrestTest.xml
target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.wakaleo.training.tweeter.domain.TagTest.xml
target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.wakaleo.training.tweeter.domain.TweetFeeRangeTest.xml
target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.wakaleo.training.tweeter.domain.TweeterTest.xml
target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.wakaleo.training.tweeter.domain.TweeterUserTest.xml

Maven also distinguishes between unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests should be fast and lightweight, providing a large amount of test feedback in as little time as possible. Integration tests are slower and more cumbersome, and often require the application to be build and deployed to a server (even an embedded one) to carry out more complete tests. Both these sorts of tests are important, and for a well-designed Continuous Integration environment, it is important to be able to distinguish between them.

-- Automating your tests with Ant

Ant also provides support for automated JUnit tests, though you have to do more low-level configuration to get it working. Ant comes with a *JUnit* task which lets you automate your JUnit tests. This is an optional task, and Ant does not actually come with the JUnit libraries built-in: you have to provide these yourself, either by placing the appropriate junit.jar and ant-junit.jar in the $ANT_HOME/lib directory, or by defining them in a <classpath> element within the <taskdef> tag.

This first approach is not a very portable solution: you need to configure the Ant installation on each machine on which the build will run, which makes it not very suitable for Continuous Integration builds. Using an embedded <classpath> element is a better solution, though this will only work with Ant 1.7 or higher.

- Configuring JUnit reports in Hudson

Once your build generates test results, you need to configure your Hudson build job to display them. For Maven build jobs, no special configuration is required - just make sure you invoke a goal that will run your tests, such as *mvn test* (for your unit tests) or *mvn verify* (for unit and integration tests).

<<Screenshot - testing-maven-verify-goal>>

For free-style build jobs, you need to do a little more configuration work. In addition to ensuring that your build actually runs the tests, you need to tell Hudson to publish the JUnit test results report. You configure this in the *Post-build Actions* section. Here, you provide a path to the JUnit XML reports. Their exact location will depend on a project - for a Maven project, a path like '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml' will find them for most projects. For an Ant-based project, it will depend on how you configured the Ant JUnit task (see above).

- Displaying test results

You can drill down into modules, packages, and test classes, and list the individual tests within a test class.

   - Drilling into JUnit test results

   - Test result trends

It can also come in handy to keep tabs on how long your tests take to run, not just whether they pass or fail. Unit tests should be designed to run fast, and overly long-running tests can be the sign of a performance issue. If your tests seem to be taking too long to run, or are taking more time than they used to, you can find out why by using the Test Result Trends graph.

At the top level, this graph tells you how long your tests have been taking to run, over time. 

<<Screenshot>>

You can also drill down and investigate at the test level. First, you need to display the list of all the tests being executed by your build:
<<Screenshot>>

From here, you can see how long each test is taking, and click on a particular test to investigate further. Within the test details, you can

This graph will tell you how long this particular test has been taking to run. If the test slowed down dramatically starting from a particular build, you'll be able to see it here.


- Skipped tests

Hudson distinguishes between test failures and skipped tests. Skipped tests are ones that have been deactivated, for example by using the @Ignore annotation in JUnit:

@Ignore 
@Test 
public void cashWithdrawalShouldDeductSumFromBalance() throws Exception {
    Account account = new Account();
    account.makeDeposit(100);
    account.makeCashWithdraw(60);
    assertThat(account.getBalance(), is(40));
}

Skipping tests is legitimate in some circumstances, such as to place an automated acceptance test, or higher-level technical test, on hold while you implement the lower levels. In such cases, you don't want to be distracted by the failing acceptance test, but you don't want to forget that the test exists either. Using techniques such as the @Ignore annotation are better than simply commenting out the test or renaming it (in JUnit 3), as it lets Hudson keep tabs on the ignored tests for you.

In TestNG, you can also skip tests, using the 'enabled' property.

@Test(enabled=false)
public void cashWithdrawalShouldDeductSumFromBalance() throws Exception {
    Account account = new Account();
    account.makeDeposit(100);
    account.makeCashWithdraw(60);
    assertThat(account.getBalance(), is(40));
}

In TestNG, you can also define dependencies between tests, so that certain tests will only run after another test or group of tests has run. 

@Test
public void serverStartedOk() {...}
 
@Test(dependsOnMethods = { "serverStartedOk" })
public void whenAUserLogsOnWithACorrectUsernameAndPasswordTheHomePageIsDisplayed() {...}

In this case, if the first test (serverStartedOk()) fails, the following test will be skipped.

In all of these cases, Hudson will mark the tests that were not run as yellow.

Hudson will tell you about the total number of tests that passed and failed, and also tell you about how this varies from the previous build. So you can get an idea of whether some tests have been fixed, or whether they are failing successively build after build.

- Test coverage metrics

Another very useful test-related metric is code coverage. Code coverage give an indication of what parts of your application where executed during the tests. While this in itself is not a sufficient indication of quality testing (it is easy to execute an entire application without actually testing anything), it is a very good indication of code that has *not* been tested. And, if your team is introducing rigorous testing practices such as Test-Driven-Development, code coverage can be a good indicator of how well these practices are being applied.

Hudson will not measure code coverage directly, but it does have several excellent code coverage reporting plugins that you can use to keep track of the code coverage in your builds.

- Using Cobertura
  - Example of Maven integration
  - Configuring the Cobertura plugin
  - Viewing the results

- Using Emma code coverage
  - Example of Maven configuration
  - Configuring the Emma plugin
  - Viewing the results

Like any other reporting, code coverage reporting is only really effective if people actually take notice of it. One way of ensuring that team members pay attention to the code coverage metrics is to review them regularly. Another approach, which requires less discipline on the team's part, involves making the code quality build fail if the code coverage is not up to scratch.
